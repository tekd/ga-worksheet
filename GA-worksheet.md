**Activity** Copy all the text from your project so far into a new JS Bin workspace. From there you can change the site to an “About Me” website about yourself. To do this you will need to do the following:

- Manipulate much of the text and tags to represent yourself… Not Jeff

- Make sure that your "Like" button functions. If it does not work ask a teacher for guidance.
